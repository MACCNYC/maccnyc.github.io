        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>The Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council (MACC) is an organization based on the guiding principles of horizontalism, anti-oppression, mutual aid, direct democracy, and direct action.
          We seek to strengthen and support New York City’s anarchist movement through coordination of existing and emerging projects.
          With the present atmosphere of hatred, bigotry and greed, we create an alternative, radical form of participatory politics.
        </p>

        <p>MACC is open to all anarchists.</p>

	<p>MACC is gathered in Lenapehoking - homeland of the Lenape people, many of whom were killed, forced to leave or go into hiding through acts of violence, land theft, and genocide. We hope to learn and grow in rebalanced and respectful relationship with the Indigenous people and other beings of this land.</p>

        <p>MACC's primary decision making body is the Organizing Assembly which currently operates on modified consensus. The Organizing Assembly is open to all participants in our monthly Care Assemblies and in MACC working groups. However, with a “democracy of direct action” ethos, MACC is a coordinating (not mandating) body, ensuring our ability to address larger questions of strategy and narrative while protecting a plurality of voices and tactics. This means working groups are free to determine their own internal structure and pursue their own vital projects. In this way, we demonstrate a vision for a society in fundamental opposition to the brutal logic of contemporary capitalism. A society based on mutual aid, cooperation, and radical democracy.</p>
