**4PM Sunday October 22nd, we will be on the street opposite the Turkish Consulate at 825 3rd Avenue (Entrance on 50th Street), New York, NY 10022.**

This is Is A Call To Action:

A Feminist Revolution of autonomous, decentralised, self-governed people is taking place in Rojava today.

In aggressive opposition stands Turkish dictator president Erdogan whose September 21st speech making in New York City was witness to violent physical assault against multiple supporters of Rojava who dared disrupt his promenading.
