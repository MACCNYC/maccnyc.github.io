It comes as no surprise when we hear that another on-duty NYPD officer has raped a woman. The epidemics of police brutality and mass incarceration that disproportionately violate black, brown, indigenous, trans, lesbian, and gender non-conforming bodies need to be stomped out.

In solidarity with victims of sexual violence committed by the police, we are calling for a demonstration in NYC on Tuesday, October 17th at Calvert Vaux Park @ 6PM. We will meet for a rally followed by a march. 
 
On September 15th, an 18 year-old woman was handcuffed here at Calvert Vaux Park in Coney Island and placed in an unmarked van by detectives Edward Martins and Richard Hall. They proceeded to rape her in a nearby parking lot and then shoved her out of the van by the 60th precinct. They are now on "modified duty," still getting paid for being professional rapists while this woman deals with the pain and trauma of her assault. She is brave in seeking justice.

We invite you to participate in this march, but while we understand the importance of inclusivity, we want to remind you that this is not a platform for those who are hoping to reform the police. Many of us are placed in a world where anyoneâ€™s next encounter with the police could be the last. 
 
We know police officers have the power to arrest people with minimal cause and throw them into jails where they are raped by correctional officers. We know that cops target and rape sex workers on the streets. We know that police departments "lose" rape kits and claim their assaults are consensual. We know that cops do "cavity searches" both publicly and privately on their chosen victims. We know that cops rape underage women. We know they commit racially motivated acts of rape and murder under the guise of law and order. We know they are well protected by their superiors, their unions, their lawyers, and the media outlets that blame victims while the vulnerable are silenced and beaten to submission.

Cops don't stop rapists because cops are rapists. It is up to us to defend our communities.
