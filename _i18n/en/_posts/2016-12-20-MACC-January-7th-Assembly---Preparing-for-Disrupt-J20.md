The Base BK

Saturday, January 7th (7PM-8:30 PM)

# THE ASSEMBLY:

The Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council (MACC) is holding its 2nd assembly on January 7th at The Base starting at 7 PM.  We’re getting concrete about our plans for the inauguration (Disrupt J20): finalizing travel plans, proposed actions in NYC & DC, and tending to logistics.  We'll also briefly address plans for a MACC press collective and our potential participation in “anti-Trump” activist coalition meetings scheduled for early January.

In our present historical moment our task is vast, but so are the possibilities.  As MACC develops we aspire not only to be at the forefront of the struggle against xenophobia, racism, misogyny and right-wing reaction, but to also go on the offensive - seeding these struggles with a form of radical, participatory politics that undermines capitalist logic at its root.
MACC assemblies are open to all anarchists, so please invite and share widely to help us build an anarchist movement forum in NYC.

### Preliminary Agenda:
