The Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council (MACC) strongly condemns the U.S. government's recent cruise missile attack on Syria for its cavalier disregard for life, obvious political motivations and destabilizing impact. Any claims of humanitarian intent behind the strike is base hypocrisy from an administration that refuses to support those fleeing the very same violence it claims to avenge. However, opposition to imperialist aggression should by no means be interpreted as support for the murderous Bashir al-Assad regime, whose war against the Syrian people has killed thousands and displaced millions, or the Russian government, whose continued efforts keep it in power. Successful resistance demands not simple-minded contrarianism but a true bottom-up revolution that transcends both nation states and the capitalist economic system. Consequently, we support the efforts of Rojava's liberated territories to resist aggression from not only the U.S. but Russia, the Assad regime, Daesh, Turkey, and any other authoritarian actor. Only a true social revolution can bring any sort of sustainable justice.
